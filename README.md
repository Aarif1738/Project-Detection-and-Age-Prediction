# Gender-Detection-and-Age-Prediction
The Gender and Age Prediction is a classification project where we have to analyze an image and Detect gender and age Prediction. This is a deep learning project where we use image classification and regression models to obtain the results.

In this project,we will use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction and visualize the results with plot graphs. We will create an image classification model for the gender Detection and a regression model for the age prediction.


# Dataset information
UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc.


The objective of the project is to detect gender and age using facial images. Convolutional Neural Network is used to classify the images. There are 2 output types namely, gender(M or F) and age.
